Subject: Request for Assistance with Linux-Related Deployment Issues

Hi Kranthi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your assistance with some ongoing challenges we are encountering in our development process.

As you may be aware, our team has been experiencing frequent environmental issues across our DEV, UAT, OAT, and Production stages during code deployment. These issues have not only been a significant source of frustration but have also led to conflicts within the team.

In an effort to address these challenges, I previously followed the guidelines outlined on the Confluence page for setting up the DEV environment. This documentation has been shared with Sravanthi for reference. However, despite these efforts, we find ourselves in need of additional support to effectively manage and troubleshoot these environments.

Given that DevOps and Linux are closely intertwined, I believe that Lathif could provide invaluable assistance in this regard. Our team, primarily composed of Python developers, has limited expertise in Linux, which is proving to be a hurdle in resolving these environment-related challenges.

I kindly request your help in arranging some form of support, possibly leveraging Lathif's expertise in Linux. This assistance would be invaluable in helping us understand and manage our deployment environments more effectively.

Thank you for considering this request. I am confident that with your support, and potentially Lathif's expertise, we can overcome these challenges and improve our team's efficiency and collaboration.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
