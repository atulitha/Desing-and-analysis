Subject: Assistance Needed with Final Step of SSO Integration - Review of Connection Payload and Metadata

Dear Sraventhi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek your guidance and expertise in resolving a critical issue I'm encountering with the Single Sign-On (SSO) integration in our current project.

As you may be aware, I'm at the final stage of the SSO setup. However, I've hit a roadblock where the server is not accepting the connection payload sent from my code. This issue is proving to be a significant hurdle in progressing towards our project milestones.

To give you a bit more context, the ADFS team recently communicated the need for metadata from our side. In response to this, my colleague Dhanunjay shared some example code from another project, which is documented on our Confluence page. This example might hold the key to resolving our current issue.

Given your experience and understanding of these systems, I kindly request your help in reviewing my current code. Your insights would be invaluable in identifying the necessary changes or adjustments needed to ensure the server accepts our connection payload. Furthermore, I would greatly appreciate it if you could review the example code provided by Dhanunjay and advise on the correct metadata that we should submit to meet the requirements set by the ADFS team.

I understand that you have a busy schedule, but considering our impending delivery deadline, your prompt support on this matter would be immensely beneficial. I am ready to provide any additional information or clarification you may need during your review.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to your valuable feedback.
