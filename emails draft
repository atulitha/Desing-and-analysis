Subject: New Requirements and Request for API Architecture Review

Dear Trupthi and Sravanthi,

I'm reaching out to request your expertise for integrating new requirements into our existing codebase, as recently outlined by Kranthi, and detailed by Srinivas.

Here's a brief overview of these requirements:

**Requirement 1: On Page Load**
- Each process should have individual date headers, with data organized according to the current active reporting date.

**Requirement 2: On Filter Selection**
- When a user selects a specific year, month, and version, the application should display a single date header for all processes and present data relevant to the selected criteria.

@sraventhi ,given these enhancements, I am currently facing challenges in figuring out how to effectively integrate these new requirements into our existing codebase. This is where, I hope your expertise will be incredibly beneficial. I would like to request both of you to review our current API architecture and provide insights to me. Your detailed assessment will help us understand the feasibility, potential challenges, and necessary adjustments required to implement these changes seamlessly.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification regarding these requirements.

Looking forward to your valuable input and guidance on this matter.
